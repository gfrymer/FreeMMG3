SIMMCAST EXAMPLES: 1-to-n transmission
======================================

General overview
----------------

This is part of a series of examples for the Simmcast network simulation
framework. Simmcast is a research project developed at the Universidade do
Vale do Rio dos Sinos (UNISINOS), in Brazil. It is free software, licensed
under the terms of the GNU General Public License (details below). You can

Example description
-------------------

In this example a source node reliably transmits packets to a group of
sink nodes. The source is directly connected through paths to the group
of sinks. The number of packets to be sent is configurable. A
stop-and-wait protocol is employed in order to achieve reliable
transmission: the source sends a DATA packet via multicast, starts a
timer, creates a set, and then waits for a positive confirmation of
receipt (ACK packet) from every sink in the group. So, each sink
responds to a DATA packet by sending an ACK packet, even if the sink has
already received such DATA packet. Each new ACK received by the source
results in the corresponding receiver being added to the set, if not
already there; when the set becomes complete, the source proceeds to the
transmission of the next DATA packet, until all DATA packets have been
transmitted and acknowledged by all sinks. If either DATA or ACK packets
are lost, the timeout maintained by the source eventually expires and
then the source retransmits the DATA packet; the sink set is not
cleared. After the last DATA packet, the source sends a number of END
packets, so that sinks receive at least one of such packets; upon doing
so, a sink sets a long timer, and when it expires, reads all pending
packets and terminates.
